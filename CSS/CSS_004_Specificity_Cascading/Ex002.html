    <h2>Cascading rule</h2>
    <div>
      We have two rules for the p selector, but the paragraph text will be blue.
      Because the declaration that sets the paragraph text to blue appears later
      in the stylesheet. Later styles replace conflicting styles that appear
      earlier in the stylesheet. This is the cascade rule.
